short_description=Checks for the presence of the Moderator badge on someone's profile.
run=Checks for the presence of the Moderator badge on someone's profile. This command displays the mod status as if you pressed the 'REQ' button in-game, but note that it doesn't actually push this button for you. It just checks for the presence of the 'M' badge on the profile, nothing else.
