short_description=Allows you to manage your connection with your Geometry Dash account.
run=Shows your account linking status. Linking your account allows UltimateGDBot to etablish a mapping between Geometry Dash users and Discord users, which can unlock a lot of possibilities. For example you can use some commands by tagging directly a Discord user instead of typing his GD username, build a server-wide Geometry Dash leaderboard (see leaderboard command), and more. Use the `link` subcommand to start linking your account, then you need to follow instructions given by the command to complete the linking process. When you have followed all instructions, type `done` in chat. To unlink your account, use the subcommand `unlink`. Note that you can link several Discord accounts to the same GD account, but you can't link several GD accounts to the same Discord account. This is designed so if you lose access to your Discord account, you can still use a new Discord account to link.
run_link=Allows you to link a Geometry Dash account to your Discord account.
run_unlink=Allows you to unlink your Geometry Dash account from your Discord account.
