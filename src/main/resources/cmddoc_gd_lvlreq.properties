short_description=Submit your levels for other players to give feedback on them.
run=Check level request status in the current server. Submit your levels in the submission queue channel using `levelrequest submit <your_level_ID>`. Then people with the reviewer role will review your submission, and once you get a certain number of reviews your level will be moved to the reveiwed levels channel and you will be notified in DMs. You are only allowed to submit a limited number of levels at once.\n\nFor more details on how level requests work, check out this guide: <https://github.com/ultimategdbot/ultimategdbot-gd-plugin/wiki/Level-Requests-Tutorial>
run_clean_orphan_submissions=Cleans orphan submissions from database (bot owner only). When a submission message is deleted manually from the queue, it is possible that the associated submission in the database does not get properly removed. It may lead to orphan submissions, that is submissions that don't exist on Discord but still exist in database. This command removes those orphan submissions from database. Note that this orphan removal process is automatically ran once a day.
run_purge_invalid_submissions=Removes all submissions referring to levels that were deleted or that were already rated.
run_review=Add a review on a level request. You can only use this command if:\n\
- You have the reviewer role, as configured in this server\n\
- You run this command in the submission channel\n\
- The targeted submission exists and hasn't already been moved out of the queue.\n\
Note that you can still add reviews to queue levels while level requests are closed, and each review must not exceed 1000 characters.\n\n\
To revoke your review from a submission, the syntax is `review <submission_ID> revoke`.
run_submit=Submit a new level request. This command can only be used in the configured submission channel, and only if level requests are opened.
run_toggle=Enable or disable level requests for this server.
