run=Displays a server-wide Geometry Dash leaderboard of the given type. All members of the current server that have a Geometry Dash account linked may be shown in the leaderboards provided by this command.\n\
`stat_name` can be one of: `stars`, `demons`, `diamonds`, `ucoins`, `scoins`, `cp` to show respectively stars, demons, diamonds, user coins, secret coins and creator points leaderboards. Leaderboards are refreshed once in a while, up to 4 times per day.
run_refresh=Refreshes the leaderboard (bot admin only). Leaderboard refresh is an heavy process that consists of loading profiles of all users that have linked their account to the bot. This command may be run once in 6 hours.
run_ban=Bans a player from server leaderboards (bot admin only). Players that are banned from leaderboards won't be displayed in the results of the `leaderboard` command in any server, regardless of whether they have an account linked. Bans are by GD account and not by Discord account, so linking with a different Discord account does not allow ban evasion.
run_unban=Unbans a player from server leaderboards (bot admin only). The player will appear in all leaderboards again.
